sexyCycle for WordPress __is not actively developed anymore__. But it should work fine with the latest version of wordpress.  
Perhaps I'll update the code in the future, but for now my focus is getting the latest version of [Good Old Gallery](https://github.com/linuslundahl/good-old-gallery/) tested and released on wp.org.

Get the latest stable version from [wordpress.org](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sexycycle-for-wordpress/).

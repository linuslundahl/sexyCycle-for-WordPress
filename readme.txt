sexyCycle is a lightweight yet very sleek jQuery plugin for making sliding image galleries. This plugin adds that functionality to WP galleries.

== Description ==

sexyCycle is a lightweight yet very sleek jQuery plugin for making sliding image galleries. And to quote it's creator: "One of the good things about sexyCycle is that you're not forced to stick with a fixed width of all images. It's actually quite nice to use different width on each image." Actually, it's now also possible to use different height thanks to Nick O'Neill.

This WordPress plugin makes it possible to add this image sliding functionality to galleries in WP, you can simply just override the `[gallery]` shortcode generated by WP or you can use it's own `[sexy-gallery]` shortcode. Galleries are handled the same way as usual by the 'Add an Image -> Gallery function'.

It's now possible to use per gallery settings, see the [Installation page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/sexycycle-for-wordpress/installation/) for documentation.

An examples of sexyCycle in action can be seen at [sexyCycle for WordPress](http://unwise.se/sexycycle-for-wordpress), more examples can be found at [sexyCycle image jQuery plugin](http://www.suprb.com/apps/sexyCycle/). (These examples are not implemented in WordPress, but they show the functionality)

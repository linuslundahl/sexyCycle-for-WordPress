sexyCycle is a lightweight yet very sleek jQuery plugin for making sliding image galleries. This plugin adds that functionality to WP galleries.

== Description ==

sexyCycle is a lightweight yet very sleek jQuery plugin for making sliding image galleries. And to quote it's creator: "One of the good things about sexyCycle is that you're not forced to stick with a fixed width of all images. It's actually quite nice to use different width on each image."

This WordPress plugin makes it possible to add this image sliding functionality to galleries in WP, you can simply just override the `[gallery]` shortcode generated by WP or you can use it's own `[sexy-gallery]` shortcode. Galleries are handled the same way as usual by the 'Add an Image -> Gallery function'.

It's now possible to use per gallery settings, see the Installation page for documentation.

Examples of sexyCycle in action can be seen at [sexyCycle image jQuery plugin](http://www.suprb.com/apps/sexyCycle/). (These examples are not implemented in WordPress, but they show the functionality)

== Installation ==

1. Upload `sexycycle-for-wordpress` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to 'Settings -> sexyCycle' to setup the plugin.
4. Upload images on a page / post and insert your gallery, alternatively insert `[sexy-gallery]` manually in html mode. (For best result all images should have the same height; if images have different heights the gallery will cut images larger than the first image.)

= Different settings for galleries =

Using variables in the shortcode enables you to setup galleries differently from post to post.

= Example: =

`[sexy-gallery size="small" animation="easeInExpo"]`  
This setting would use small images and the animation easeInExpo instead of the defaults.

= Settings available: =

* __Animation:__ `animation=` "easeInQuad", "easeOutQuad", "easeInOutQuad", "easeInCubic", "easeOutCubic", "easeInOutCubic", "easeInQuart", "easeOutQuart", "easeInOutQuart", "easeInQuint", "easeOutQuint", "easeInOutQuint", "easeInSine", "easeOutSine", "easeInOutSine", "easeInExpo", "easeOutExpo", "easeInOutExpo", "easeInCirc", "easeOutCirc", "easeInOutCirc", "easeInElastic", "easeOutElastic", "easeInOutElastic", "easeInBack", "easeOutBack", "easeInOutBack", "easeInBounce", "easeOutBounce", "easeInOutBounce"
* __Animation speed:__ `speed=` "int" (milliseconds)
* __Auto cycle speed:__ `interval=` "int" (milliseconds)
* __Use controls:__ `controls=` "0", "under", "beforeafter"
* __Image click:__ `imgclick=` "0", "image", "nothing" (0 = swap to next image)
* __Previous text:__ `prev=` "string"
* __Next text:__ `next=` "string"
* __Use stop:__  `controls_stop=` "boolean" (0/1)
* __Stop text:__ `stop=` "string"
* __Use caption:__ `caption=` "0", "caption", "desc"
* __Disable cycle at end:__ `cycle=` "boolean" (0/1)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

No FAQ available at the moment.

= Known Issues =

* Captions disappear and reappear when cycling restarts.
* Using images with different heights can make for some interesting results. (Always try to use same height, different width is okay though)
